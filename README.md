Workflow
User Input:

The user enters a list of ingredients they have, separated by commas.
Input Processing:

The system processes the input to normalize it (e.g., trimming whitespace and converting to lowercase).
Recipe Database:

A static list or a dynamic database of recipes is maintained, each with its associated ingredients.
Matching Logic:

The system compares the user’s input with the ingredients of each recipe in the database.
It checks for matches to identify which recipes can be made using the provided ingredients.
Recommendation Generation:

Recipes that match the user’s ingredients are collected and ranked if necessary.
